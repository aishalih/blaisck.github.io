  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>In the early days I learned to design print products such as brochures, banners, stickers. And then after that, I started to follow online design competitions, mostly designed logos, and a little in UI design. Now, I am studying in depth about digital design such as designing engaging and user-friendly interface for web or mobile applications, and studying illustrations. In my spare time, I learned web programming.</p>
